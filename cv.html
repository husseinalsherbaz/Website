    Personal Statement: 
    </h1>
<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">
    Iâ€™m a motivated and curious student who is passionate technology. From my extra-curricular
activities, I have developed good time management skills which has motivated me to apply for a part-time role that I
can balance with my studies. A work experience opportunity at Santander would provide me with a platform to build a
career within Technology.

<h2>
    WORK EXPERIENCE:
</h2>
<p>
    Following my One-week work experience in Triton Square, I had been selected through a vetting process where I had
    to answer 3 questions and be recorded when answering them. This was a paid work experience where I worked 35
    hours a week. I was in an office environment which I was familiar with from my week at Santander. In the 4 weeks I
    had to attend team meetings, complete work set by my mentor, complete an online training course with 12 modules
    and do research on Meta data. This experience had really opened my eyes up to what I would be experiencing in an
    apprenticeship. I also saw what the UX design team were doing to their website to make it better for the users. I found
    that I was really interested in this side of Santander. I felt as if I could really get into this and make a very good and
    user-friendly web page. I also had a meeting with the chatbot team which I also found really interesting as they use A.I
    to help with any queries the customer has asked. I believe this would be a very good place for me to work in because it
    is a new piece of technology and it has a long way to go and a lot of gaps to fill and I would love to be a part of that.
